# PDF-Chatbot-Interface
This project develops an interactive Gradio-based PDF chat application that enables users to upload PDF documents and engage in real-time natural language conversations about the content. The app extracts and preprocesses text from PDFs, indexes  for efficient retrieval, and uses a conversational interface to answer user queries, provide summaries.
